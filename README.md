# Network Highlight Overlay

Network Highlight Overlay is a **Cities: Skylines 1** mod that highlights selected network types (roads, rails, pedestrian paths, transit infrastructure, bridges, tunnels, etc.) with customizable colors. 
It is useful for debugging, visual clarity, screenshots, and inspecting hidden / underground / service networks. During my testing, it worked for insivible (workshop) paths, too.

**This mod depends on Harmony 2 and Unified UI (UUI).**

## Features

Highlights the following network types:
- Pedestrian paths
- Roads
- Highways
- Tram tracks / trolley lanes
- Train
- Metro 
- Monorails
- Cablecar paths

Fully **color-customizable** using hue sliders

## Overlay toggle:

F9 hotkey / UUI Button

Should be compatible with any other render-based mod (non-destructive)
